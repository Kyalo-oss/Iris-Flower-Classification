## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook:

```jupyter notebook iris-flower-solution.ipynb```

Run the cells in the notebook to see the data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Loading:** Load the Iris dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the decision boundaries and results.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Models
The notebook includes the implementation and evaluation of the following machine learning models:
- Logistic Regresssion
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Visualization
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
The notebook provides visualizations for the decision boundaries and support vectors for the SVM classifier, as well as scatter plots for the other models.
